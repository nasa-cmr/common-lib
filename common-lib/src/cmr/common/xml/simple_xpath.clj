(ns cmr.common.xml.simple-xpath
  "Simple XPath is an XPath implementation that works against XML parsed with clojure.data.xml
  and against Clojure records.

  It has a limited support for the XPath specification. These are examples of XPaths that are
  supported. See the tests for a full set of example XPaths.

  * From root: /catalog/books/author
  * Within current context: author/name
  * Subselect by attribute equality: /catalog/books[@id='bk101']/author
  * Subselect by element equality: /catalog/books[price='5.95']/title
  * Subselect by child index: /catalog/books[1]/author
  * Subselect by range of child indexes /catalog/books[2..4]/author.  Openended ranges like [2..]
  are supported as well. (Note this is not a standard XPath feature.) Indexes are 1 based arrays. Both
  start and end indexes are inclusive.

  Note that there will be undefined behavior if an unsupported XPath is used.

  Note that simple XPath does not support namespaces in XPaths. It ignores any XPath tag name prefixes
  i.e. /xsl:foo/xsl:bar is equivalent to /foo/bar.

  ## Using with XML:

  1. Create an XPath context with some XML using `create-xpath-context-for-xml`
  2. Parse the XPath using `parse-xpath`
  3. Evaluate the XPath against the XPath context using `evaluate`.

  ## Using with Clojure Data:

  1. Create an XPath context with some Clojure data using `create-xpath-context-for-data`
  2. Parse the XPath using `parse-xpath`
  3. Evaluate the XPath against the XPath context using `evaluate`.

  ### How XPaths against Clojure Data work

  An XPath like /catalog/books in XML would look for a root element called catalog with one or more
  subelements called books. When using with Clojure data element tags are treated like looking for
  keys in a set of nested maps. The first tag within data xpaths are ignored because it assumes the
  first tag is the name of the data. For example evaluating /catalog/books would work with
  `{:books [...]}` which assumes that the map is the catalog. The xpath would evaluate to the vector
  the `:books` key refers to.

  ## XPath Contexts

  XPath contexts are used as the input to evaluation and also are the output of evaluation. They
  contain three pieces of information: a type (data or xml), the root of the data, and the context.
  The type indicates whether the xpath context is used for Clojure data or parsed XML. The root of
  the data is kept so that XPaths against the root can be evaluated (/catalog/books). The context
  is used so that higher level XPaths may specify a location within the data to evaluate lower level
  XPaths against.

  The `:context` key always contains the result of an XPath evaluation."
