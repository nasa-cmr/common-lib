(ns cmr.common.cache.single-thread-lookup-cache
  "Defines a cache that serializes all calls to execute the lookup function on a single thread. It
  should be used when the lookup function is very expensive and you want to minimize the number of
  times it's called.

  When the value is already cached the request for a value is very fast. When the value is not
  cached a request is queued to fetch the value. A separate thread processes these requests off a
  core.async channel. The processing this way forces the serialization of cache lookups during a
  cache miss. Earlier cache requests will likely populate the cache with a single request using
  the lookup function. This will allow the subsequent queued requests to avoid calling the lookup
  function.

  This cache implements the cmr.common.lifecycle/Lifecycle protocol and must be started and stopped
  because it has a separate running thread."
